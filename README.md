# legacy-php

... because we all need to run old shit.

### Why use legacy-php?

 - You don't need to worry about updates or security patches!
 - (... because this is built on trusted end-of-life software)
 - A big pile of shit in a small package!
 - every PHP5.* version >=5.2.4 with as much options as I could find (PRs welcome!)
